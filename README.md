# Implementation-of-voice-and-gesture-control-to-a-smart-adaptive-vehicle

The purpose of robotics in commercial & residential intention has come to be quite essential for
executing challenging work in a more conveniently simple way. There is a lot of research work
going on to enhance the connection between humans and robots. The main aim of this project is
to implement voice and gesture control applications to a smart adaptive vehicle. The existing
Bluetooth-controlled vehicle with an embedded system is not suitable for blind or hand-disabled
individuals to travel from one place to another. So, this project aims to create a solution for them.
The primary objective of this project is to implement voice and gesture commands to control the
vehicle. The v3 microphone module is used to record voice commands to send to an Arduino uno
microcontroller. For gesture control operation, gyroscope is used to send input commands which
are helpful for those who cannot speak. This vehicle can perform various operations viz., forward,
backward, left, right, wake-up and shut-down. The existing Bluetooth based controller is upgraded
by adding voice and gesture control applications. Sequential operations are performed to switch
from one command to another by adding a switching module.
